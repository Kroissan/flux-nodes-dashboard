# Flux - Node Monitoring tool

A tool to monitor all your flux nodes at once (benchmark, version, rank, ...). Greatly inspired by [Flux HomeUI](https://github.com/RunOnFlux/flux)

## Build Setup

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:16126
npm run homedev

# build for production with minification
npm run homebuild

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run homebuild --report
```
